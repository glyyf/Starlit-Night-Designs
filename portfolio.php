        <p>The site your currently on. This is my playground, home to all my ideas, experiments, and random musings. I guess it's something akin to a capital ship among the rest of my work. I wanted to showcase my work with CSS Trasitions, as you'll note by pressing one of the three buttons up front, and be sure to hover over certain parts of the page in vibrant mode, the page may react to you! Regardless, enjoy your stay and send me a message if you need anything!</p>

        <p>The client wanted their POS software up front and center, while also focusing on the actual in-shop repairs as a secondary focus, and I like how it turned out. This one's pretty straight forward, a basic wordpress installation that's easy to manage and keep up with. Also due to the nature of the client, it's 100% mobile responsive, as they probably won't be looking at it with their computers.</p>

        <p>This one was fun, I helped the owner design this one, and got to play with several different wordpress plugins, and really tried to push the limits of the wordpress engine. Has some great animations, and of course, fully responsive and mobile friendly.</p>

        <p>Same company as the one above, but this time focusing on repairs. Pretty much used the exact same process as the original site. Also did a type of community hub for them, but didn't link it here, as its pretty much the same type of thing.</p>

        <p>A bit of an older design, but it's also my favorite. Why? Because it was my first one. I had no idea what I was doing and jumped in with two feet. I had no idea about frameworks, libraries, anything of the sort on this one, so I started from the ground up and wrote everything. My favorite thing to mention about this one, is I wrote the entire backend too. A full inventory management system, complete with on page search functions, written entirely from the ground up with PHP and SQL. Good stuff, and that's when I didn't know what I was doing.</p>

            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>There's not really that much to say about me. My name is Spencer Grimes, and I was born and raised in Atlanta, GA, but am curently living in Panama City, FL. I love working with computers, be it repairs, programming, tinkering, whatever. I am CCENT Certified, which means I can build and manage networks as well. I am a native English speaker, but am also at a conversational level in both Spanish and Mandarin Chinese. No really, 你好啊，我叫夏志愿！My hobbies include programming (obviously), playing the piano, and physics. I also enjoy video games with my friends, my favorites being Eve Online, Starcraft II, and Super Smash Brothers. I think that just about covers me in a nutshell, if you have any questions, or just want to say hi, feel free to send me an <a href="mailto:toamidan@gmail.com">email</a>.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thanks!</p><br>
